	{A project conducted outside normal study time for creating the 6th satellite for the university. I have worked with:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Fault tolerance, deadlock avoidance and formal/model verification of the software mainly in UPPAAL
        \item Formal/model verification of the communications protocol 
        \item Version control and continuous build system for the whole project
        \item An extra payload, in the form of an extra processor, to detect and count bit flips while being bit flip safe itself
        \end{itemize}
    Additionally, I created proposals for 2017 master theses within the above-mentioned fields with Prof. Ren√© Rydhof Hansen}
